# Planet Labs Technical Assessment: Anagrams

Main program: anagram_finder.py

Requirements: Python 2.7 or Python 3.4 

Execution: python anagram_finder.py dictionary_of_words.txt

Instructions: An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another, like "topside" and "deposit". In some cases, there might be as many (or more) anagrams than there are characters, like "post", "spot", "stop" and "tops".

Write a program to find all of the anagrams in a dictionary in which there are at least 4 letters in the word and at least as many anagrams as there are letters.

The dictionary will be a file on disk with one line per word. Your operating system likely already has such a file in /usr/dict/words or /usr/share/dict/words.

The output produced by your code should be in this format:

    emit, item, mite, time
    merit, miter, mitre, remit, timer
    reins, resin, rinse, risen, serin, siren
    inert, inter, niter, retin, trine
    inset, neist, snite, stein, stine, tsine

Tested on Mac OS X and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
